                            Application of UVC light in an appropriate wavelength of 260nm-280nm helps disinfect objects against various bacteria and viruses. The object can be placed inside the UV sterilization box by gently opening and closing the lid. Once it fits into the chamber, the disinfection key in the front end of the box begins to disinfect once pressed. The UVC light inside the box penetrates through the viruses and bacteria on the surface of the object.  It must be noted that “UVC”, “UV disinfection” and “UV” as used here and in the scientific, medical and technical literature, specifically and importantly refers to UVC light energy (200-280nm light). Normal cleaning and disinfection may leave behind some residual contamination, which UVC can treat suggesting that a multiple disinfectant approach is prudent. UVC has been shown to achieve a high level of inactivation of a near-relative of COVID-19’s virus. A safety cut feature is also provided to prevent accidental exposure.

            No need to sanitise your car key, wallet, currency, or smartphone every time you step in or out of your vehicle. Just place everything inside this multi-functional UV steriliser box that kills 99.9% of germs within three minutes. An online shopping portal, The Messy Corner, has debuted UV Care Sterilizer, a smart and multi-functional UV steriliser that, it claims, can kill 99.9% of germs that live on the surface of phones, earphones, watches, wallets, keys, and other daily accessories and gadgets in just three minutes. Priced at Rs 3,999, this device doubles up as a wireless charger and can be hooked to the 12v charging port in your car.

            The idea behind creating this UV steriliser came at a time when the importance of health, safety, and hygiene has become the utmost priority for people on the go.
            <!-- “We observed that many people apply sanitiser on their keys, wallets, and currency notes every time they return to their cars after shopping. With the UV Care Sterilizer, they can avoid this exercise by simply putting all the items in the portable box. It is compact enough to be kept inside the car’s glovebox too,” says Aanchal Poddar, co-founder and creative head, The Messy Corner.

            Company officials say the product is extremely simple to use. Just plug in the device, open the lid and put your phone and other small accessories inside, close the lid and press the button. After three minutes, there will be a beep which marks the completion of the sterilisation process. Aayush Poddar, co-founder and marketing head says, “Our phones and many daily accessories such as rings and watches carry 6.5 times more bacteria on the surface than a toilet seat. And using alcohol-based sanitisers to clean the same is not a safe option. The UVC light in our UV Sterilizer is absolutely safe for gadgets. This sterilisation method is in fact used widely in hospitals to decontaminate hospital rooms as well as medical instruments.”

            Talking about the key features, the UV Care Sterilizer has a stylish design and modern looks. It can sterilise things such as rings, keys, masks, sunglasses, wallets, pens, other than your phone. One can also add a few drops of perfume in the space given inside the box to add a subtle fragrance to your accessories.  -->

            These are questions I hear a lot working in the microbiology field, especially when people think about how dirty their cell phone gets. With more and more UV sterilization products coming on the market, you might be wondering if they are worth trying. So, let’s dig in!
            UV light has been used for sterilization and disinfection as early as the mid-20th century. With advancements in technology, and specifically in the UV bulbs themselves, its reliable long lifespan (thousands-of-hours) and smaller size (e.g. UV LED vs traditional UV bulbs) has broadened the field for where it can be used. You can find it being used to disinfect: water, air, fruits, vegetables, surgical utensils, tablet computers, toys and a variety of surfaces.

                                UVC is dangerous to humans. That is why UV sterilization is usually done using UVC lamps with protective shields. Remember to avoid direct exposure to UVC, especially skin and eyes.

                                It has a major limit! UV only works in its light path and can be blocked by objects. Make sure what you want sterilized is directly in line with the UV light. You can minimize this issue by using multiple UV bulbs to generate UV irradiation from different angles.
