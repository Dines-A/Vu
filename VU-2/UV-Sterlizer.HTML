                            Covid-19 has changed our lives in more ways than one. Disinfecting accessories one uses all the time such as wallets, smartphone, ear pods or watches has become a part of our daily life. However, sanitizing car keys or earphones is not an easy job. A UV Care Sterilizer can kill germs that live on the surface of your phones, earphones, watches, and other daily accessories and gadgets. This multi-functional sterilizer can kill 99.9% of germs in just 3 minutes. UV Care Sterilizer can disinfect various things such as rings, keys, masks, sunglasses, wallets, pens, currency, other than phones.

                            UV sterilizer is used to control infections by stopping the spread of microorganisms from one fish/coral/invertebrate to another through the water. It is also used in pond applications to control free-floating algae. When operated correctly, free-floating microorganisms will be killed by the UV light.
                            <!-- That's why UV light sanitizers can be a great alternative to products that might be out of stock. With any new technology, there will understandably be doubts about effectiveness, but research proves that in most cases UV sanitizers are effective in killing 99% of germs -->
                            UV light sterilization effectively inactivates microorganisms by damaging the DNA of cells. DNA is responsible for cell replication, thus damaging the structure of the DNA renders cells unable to replicate and unable to spread disease. The UV photons are absorbed by the cell, creating pyrimidine dimers.

                            However, by using the UV sterilizer you can prevent the spreading of the diseases floating freely in the water.<!--  This will help save the fish you love. -->

                        UV Sterilizer primarily works by using special bulbs that can emit the right amount of Ultra Violet (UV)-C light that is needed to kill bacteria on smooth surfaces. UV light is considered effective as it damages the DNA of bacteria and the DNA or RNA of viruses. That said, if you damage the DNA of the bacteria it dies, and if you damage the nucleic acid of the virus enough it cannot infect.
                    According to a study conducted by the University of Arizona your mobile phone is said to be a hot spot for germs they found that it can carry 10 times more bacteria than most toilet seats.
                    So if you're looking to test out UV-C sanitation for your smartphone, we found a few products that you can consider buying.

                            But some bacteria should concern you. “We’re not walking through a sterile environment, so if you touch a surface there could be something on that,” says Susan Whittier, director of clinical microbiology at New York-Presbyterian and Columbia University Medical Center. “There are lots of environmental contaminants.”
                            
                            Studies have found serious pathogens on cell phones, including Streptococcus, MRSA and even E. coli. Just having these microbes on your phone won’t automatically make you sick, Whittier says, but you still don’t want to let 
                            them enter your system. Viruses can also spread on phones if one person is sick with strep throat or influenza and coughs on their cell phone before handing it off to a friend.
                          It will also not kill beneficial bacteria unless they flow through the water.

                            Fortunately, there are easy ways to avoid some germs. One of the worst places to use your phone is in the bathroom, Martin and Whittier both agree. When toilets flush, they spread germs everywhere, which is how phones end up with fecal bacteria like E. coli. “Taking a cell phone into the bathroom and then leaving with it is kind of like going in, not washing your hands and then coming back out,” Martin says. “It’s the same level of concern.”
                            Keeping your phone out of the bathroom will help, but if you want to clean your phone, a few different 
                            methods will work.
                            The company says it uses far ultraviolet light to kill 99.9 percent of germs on the toilet, sink and other surfaces where bacteria can lurk.It claims three seconds of exposure to far UV light is enough to disinfect all the surfaces in the room.

                            Many people just wipe their phones with a soft microfiber cloth, which will remove many of the germs. For a deeper clean, Whittier recommends using a combination of 60% water and 40% rubbing alcohol. Mix the ingredients together, and then dip a cloth in the solution before wiping it gently across your phone. Unless you’re sick, doing this a few times each month is plenty, Whittier says. Stay away from liquid or spray cleaners, which can damage your phone.
                            Still, the best advice has more to do with you than the phone. Wash 
                             your hands several times a day, the experts say, and  you’ll likely be just fine.
                             Testing is fairly simple. If you have a lumed watch, then place it in the box and irradiate it for 10 seconds. The lume should glow brightly.
                             many of the people uses pocket sterlizer.
